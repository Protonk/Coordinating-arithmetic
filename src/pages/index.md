# Coordinating Arithmetic

Despite the wide influence and impact of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, historical work on it is limited. Prior work on the standard has focused narrowly on the work of the IEEE 754 committee and not the response of the larger knowledge communities.

Our primary research question asks how interdisciplinary knowledge communities collaborated on reliable numerical computation amidst a rapid proliferation of software, hardware, and stakeholders. Using floating-point arithmetic as an engineering case study, we will explore how engineers and communities responded to the evolving problem of reliable numerical computing and the revolutionary impact of the standard on computing practice.

Our goal is to undertake a history of how knowledge communities in engineering coordinated around the problem of reliable numerical computing. We will follow the creation of a standard for computer arithmetic (IEEE 754) and document the work and collaboration which accompanied the standard as well as response to it.

This research will contribute to understanding of and engagement with students, educators, practitioners, and researchers on the historical antecedents and wider, multi-faceted social contexts of the construction, adoption, and use of numerical computing.
